- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrei, aka @soitirakis
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and AI. I am a rookie in this field, so any help and guidance are well appreciated. The most difficult part for me at this moment is in
- structuring correctly and ellegant my code. Usually my code is a mess and it is not reusable. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and preparing to dive into Machine Learning using Tensorflow. For the moment I am fighting against CS50 Python https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/ and CS50x https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/; which I strongly recommend. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to web developement, front-end or back-end. I am eager to learn new things and tricks. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email zbu_04@yahoo.com
